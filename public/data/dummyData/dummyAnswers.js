        Commentary: "I had asked this question to my twin flame when we breifly reconnected on Facebook for few days. It was very direct. I asked, “I feel a very strong connection with you, and if I feel it then, you also must be feeling it. As the connection needs to be from both the sides. Do you feel it?” Now the catch is ..they will answer only what they feel is right at that particular juncture of their journey.  So my twin flame, did not say yes and did not say no. But made some statements which said, I am important to him and he cares for me.  My experience is, when they get to a point to expressing themselves, they will express it on their own. Later as we progressed and reconnected again, he himself expressed a lot of stuff on his own when I least expected it.  But when it comes to us, it is better to be as direct as possible. With no fear. Ask straight questions. And know that they may not be prepared to answer your questions. But still asking a question is important.",

        questionId: 1,
        Commentary: "Timing is everything. The frustrating thing about the twin flame process is that it is rife with ambiguity in what should be normally, easily understood words. What I mean is that you can ask a simple question to your twin and it can trigger something deep, not because of the words, but because it is you who spoke them. Be careful in your approach and gauge the tenor of the relationship, the spiritual maturity of both twins and ask yourself why you want the confirmation.",

        Commentary: "If you already have this feeling for someone you know, then they might be your TF. If you have a feeling that in future you will meet your TF, then you will just have to wait for that time to come to get the better clarity.  But for the former case, if your soul and your intuition tells you that someone is your TF, then I suggest they are. You can also look for signs of having a TF and match it with your scenario.",

        questionId: 2,
        Commentary: "I don’t know why you think you have a Twin Flame but I can tell you that the signs are: 1. A separation occurs between both Twins.  2. Dark Night of the Soul. 3. Obsessive thinking about the Twin.  4. Physical pain in one of your chakras.  It is an absolutely life changing event. There is no questioning that something significant is happening to you and for you. You know that it is something Spiritual. There is no questioning that aspect of it.",

        Commentary: "If they are indeed your Twin Flame - most likely they also think about you or feel your presence, since your energy and emotions are connected. But if they are not your TF, this can be one-sided and more like wishful thinking.",

        questionId: 4,
        Commentary: "A twin flame is you in another form. It is as simple as that. They are your energetic identity and once you discover them, even if you are not aware of the concept of twin flames, you will be drawn to them and perhaps even repulsed by them, depending on your vibrations. As you both raise your vibrations, you will become more drawn to each other.  Those who are twin flames have a sense of missing something within them. They know almost instinctually that there is more to them than their own self. Because there is only a pair of twin flames and no more, the emotional, energetic, thought process and attraction is most intense.  You can occupy your time and try to create diversions, but the reality is that twin flames who have incarnated at the same time on earth, have done so for a reason. The universe will not allow the eternal bond to be severed and will create synchronous events to bring twin flames together. It is a blessing and a curse. Be gentle with your twin flame. You only get one.",

        Commentary: "Trying to stop thinking about or twins is nearly impossible because it would be like forgetting about yourself. Like in Star Trek with the cyborgs, Resistance is futile lol. You are pretty much a collective with your twin. The only thing that I can suggest is to try and think as positively as possible about them. Remember the good times and all the things that they have done for you.",
