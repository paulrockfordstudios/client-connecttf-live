        about: "IT Technician by day, dj by night. I ride my bike to work everyday.",
        story: "<p>&emsp;&emsp; I met my tf David at a wedding event that I djed for when I was 31, right before my birthday, 4 years ago. He came up and requested a song be played for his friend. He spent the rest of the event at my booth chatting with me. There was a strange connection.  I didn't think much of it at the time as I was working, but the feel was magnetic. Afterwards, we went to an after party togther and thats when we really connected.  I felt like I knew him my whole life.  He spent the night with me and we hooked up. It was one of the most amazing nights of my life.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; We dated for a few weeks in the beginning and then things started to get weird and complicated.  At first it felt as if we were completely in sync (I'm not talking about the band). It felt like we were more compatible than anyone I had ever been with before....Even more compatible than me and my family members. When I was hungry, he was hungry...A we even wanted the same foods. When I was tired, he was tired. Even when we were away from each other, it was still the same. I even felt like I could smell what he was smelling and taste what he was tasting. I even felt like we were communicating to each other almost on a telepathic level. It was a very enlightening time! And probably the best time of my life so far!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Even though it seemed everything was perfect. It soon turned into the worst time of my life.  David left one day and completely ghosted me! He just picked up and left as if I didn't mean anything to him! I tried to get in touch with him but he wouldn't return any of my texts or calls. A week and half later, he came into the club that I was djing at with another man.  He seemed so happy and he didn't say to me once.  As soon as I had a free moment, I went over and confronted him.  He told me it wasn't what he wanted and that he met someone else and that I should be happy for him.  He spent the rest of the night rubbing his happiness in my face and I could do nothing but was forced to watch as I was working.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; After our breakup, I cut my self off from everyone. I did not want to see or talk to anyone. I basically went into hiding. I was very rough. I was so hurt by what he did.  As awesome as we were, I did not think he would ever treat me like that. The hardest part was that I loved him and cared for him so much and I couldn't understand why I couldn't get over him. There were days where I couldn't even get out of bed. I had never felt like that before in my life.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; A few months later, he contacted me out of nowhere. by this time, I started to get back on with my life as best as I could.  He said that him and thatother guy had ended and he thought we should meet for coffee. reluctantly I agreed to it. When we met up, he was telling me how much he missed me and how much he wanted me back.  I tried telling him about the pain I was in and he didn't seem to care. It seemed like it was all about him. I started asking him if he noticed a connection between us or any of the weird things that I experienced.  He said he felt we had a connection and thats it. Everything else he blew off as though he didn't experience any of it.  He just kept telling me that he missed the way I made him feel and that he was so attracted to me. He kept trying to talk me into going back to my place. I couldn't though. At the moment I felt so repulsed by his attitude and behavior but what made it weird was that I felt so magnetically attracted to him at the same time....almost literally. It felt like our sould were joining together as we sat there and talked.  The was this wierd energy in the air and it seemed as all eyes were on us. I felt as though everything around us was in sync with us. It was so weird.  What was weirder was that he acted as though nothing was happening although I could see in his eyes that he could feel it too. The energy got so intense, I had to leave. I left him sitting there. I have seem him since.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; After that day at the coffee shop, my world has flipped upside down!!! I have become spiritual.  I changed my diet and the food I eat.  I stopped hanging around my friends. I stopped talking to certain members of my family. I totally changed almost every spect of my life. I started searching for meaning in my life and searching for what was happening to me.  I came across the term twin flames. I heard it befor and thought there was nothing to it but after my experiences, everything started feeling as thoug this is exactly what I was going through. I started search for and sifting through all the information I could find on the subject. Most inforametion out there is garbage and misleading. Most of it is people wishing they had a connection like that and thinking everyone they are with is there twin flame. There was very few places that had some sort of solid information.  Most of which were couples saying online saying there were twin flames in union and that they were coaches. I started following a few of them.  Even though this brought me some comfort, I felt really alone and seperated from everyone and everything.  I didn't know whether to trust any information I found online or not. I just felt as though some of the twin flame people online knew what I was going thorugh.  I wanted to connect with them but it was hard as though there was no real way to talk to them except commenting on there youtube,instagram or other social media pages. Most of them offer coaching and I signed up for one of their sites but I felt as though it wasn't enough.  I felt like there were other iin the exact same place that I am in that just need to talk to others going through similar things.  Then I found this site. Since then, I don't feel as alone on this journey as I did before.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I cut of all contact with David. He has tried contacting me since but I felt as though he was mature enough to handle our connection.  I had to let go and figure  this out on my own and I knew the only way he could figure it on his own was for me to leave. We haven't spoken or seen each other in almost for years. I can feel that we are in a good place now though. It is  if we are together. I talk to him everyday in my minds eye and I go about my life living to be the best that I can.  I feel as though I can live my purpose and I feel as though I need to help others who are on the journey and are going through similar things that I went through. I am starting my own coaching and am soon be offering coaching to anyone who needs it. As for me and David, I'm not sure when I will see him again but I know I will and we may one day be together again. As for now, I am happy and ready to help others. Thank you for reading my story. If you have any questions or want to no mare, feel free to message me. Nameste.</p>",

        story: "Hi. My name is Tiffany. I am happily married. I've been married for 5 years. I met my husband in high school and have been together ever since. I met a guy at an open house about 2 months ago and I haven't been the same ever since. We have a deep intense connection. When I looked in his eyes, I saw home and forever. I never imagined having a connection like this. I'm also happily married to the love of my life! I wqould never hurt him or leave him. I plan on spending te rest of my life with ihm. This guy I have a connection with isn't even my type. He is a little cute but I love my husband. I can't break this intense connection though. I haven't seen him since. He got my number from my business card and I feel like he is stalking me. He tries to cal like once a week and he texts me all the time. I told hm that if he wasn't buying a house then he should leave me alone. I don't want to e mean but I will have to block him if I have too. The weird thing is, I'm not scared of him... and sometimes I even fantasize about him with any control. I need help. I don't know what is happening in my life.",
